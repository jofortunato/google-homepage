# Emulate the Google Homepage

This project is part of the **'The Odin Project'** foundations course on front end development.

**Live Previews:** [Google Homepage](https://jofortunato.github.io/google-homepage/)

As an extra assignment, I've also replicated a typical **Google search results page**, see it **[here](https://jofortunato.github.io/google-homepage/search-results.html)**.
